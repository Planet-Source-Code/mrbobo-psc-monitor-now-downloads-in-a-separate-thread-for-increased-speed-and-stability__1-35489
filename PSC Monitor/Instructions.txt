The original version of this PSC Monitor used API to download the source code of a selected PSC web page and parsed this source code for specific data. It did this job well, but the application was unresponsive whilst downloading was taking place. 
To overcome this problem it now uses a separate tiny exe file (BBdowner.exe - source code included) to download the data in a separate thread, thus allowing for multiple tasks being carried out simultaneously and allowing the app to be reponsive even during downloading.
I hope you appreciate the increased stability and speed.

Before running PSC Monitor, compile BBdowner.exe and place in the same folder as PSCMonitor.exe, thats all - easy!
